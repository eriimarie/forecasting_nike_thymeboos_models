	•	Nike: Focuses on weekly and monthly sales predictions using Matplotlib visualizations.
	•	ThymeBoos: Involves data cleaning, resampling, and forecasting techniques to uncover insights from sales performance.

Both projects apply core time series techniques to help visualize and understand sales trends over time.
