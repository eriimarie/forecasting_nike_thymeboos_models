# Time Series Predictions Model

This repository contains time series forecasting projects focused on predicting sales trends for two datasets: **Nike** and **ThymeBoos**.

## Projects Overview

- **Nike**: Focuses on weekly and monthly sales predictions using Matplotlib visualizations.
- **ThymeBoos**: Involves data cleaning, resampling, and forecasting techniques to uncover insights from sales performance.

Both projects apply core time series and forecasting techniques to visualize and understand sales trends over time.

## About the Nike Forecasting Model

This project is focused on using machine learning to forecast and predict future trends for Nike Time Boost models.  
The goal is to build a predictive model that can estimate future sales, customer behavior, or stock levels using data from the Nike dataset.

Using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebook**, this project explores various machine learning techniques, including:
- Regression models
- Time series forecasting
- Feature engineering and selection

The model is currently being improved for accuracy and performance.
